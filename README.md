# Object-Detection
This project implements object detection in video frames using the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm. Given a query image, the system scans a target video, detects the presence of the object in each frame, and highlights matches by drawing rectangles around them. The result is exported as a new annotated video.
